# InstructPix2Pix: Learning to Follow Image Editing Instructions

This repository contains the code implementation of InstructPix2Pix, an instruction-based image editing model, based on the original [CompVis/stable_diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) repository. This project aims to allow users to provide textual instructions to guide image editing tasks, enabling creative and intuitive image transformations.

## Overview

InstructPix2Pix is a PyTorch implementation that leverages the power of pre-trained models and text-to-image synthesis techniques to enable users to edit images based on textual prompts. By fine-tuning from an initial Stable Diffusion checkpoint, this model can learn to understand and follow user instructions to generate edited images.

## Features

- Edit images based on textual instructions.
- Fine-tune the model for specific editing tasks.
- Generate high-quality edited images with intuitive prompts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Gradio (for interactive editing app)
