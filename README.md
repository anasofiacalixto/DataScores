# InstructPix2Pix: creating choreographic scores from text prompts

This repository contains the code implementation of InstructPix2Pix, an instruction-based image editing model, based on the original [CompVis/stable_diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) repository. This project aims to allow users to provide text instructions to guide image editing tasks, to edit images that will serve as choreographic scores for a performance, for study intent and non commercial use.

## Overview

InstructPix2Pix is a PyTorch implementation that leverages the power of pre-trained models and text-to-image techniques to allow users to edit images based on text prompts. In this case, the images were edited with prompts from a book, in order to create movement scores for the performer to follow.
